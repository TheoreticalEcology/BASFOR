\title{Run the forest model BASFOR}
\usage{
run_model(ft = FORTYPE, p = params, w = matrix_weather,
  calf = init$calendar_fert, calN = init$calendar_Ndep,
  calpT = init$calendar_prunT, caltT = init$calendar_thinT, n = NDAYS,
  NOUT = init$NOUT)
}
\arguments{
\item{ft}{Integer which indicates the forest type and is set to 1 for coniferous and 2 for deciduous}

\item{p}{Vector that contain the model parameters. The order of the parameters in the vector is important and should be consistent with the provided dataset df_params.}

\item{w}{Matrix that contains the model input weather data with dimensions [number of timesteps, number of weather inputs]. The seven weather inputs are: year, day of year, radiation (MJ/day), mean air temperature (deg C), precipitation (mm/day), surface wind speed (m/s) and vapour pressure (kPa)}

\item{calf}{Matrix timeseries of fertilization of dimension [length of timeseries, date vector of length 3]. Where the date vector is made up of (year, day of year, fertilization in kgN /day /m^2)}

\item{calN}{Matrix timeseries of N depostion of dimension [length of timeseries, date vector of length 3]. Where the date vector is made up of (year, day of year, N deposition in kgN /day /m^2)}

\item{calpT}{Matrix timeseries of prunings of dimension [length of timeseries, date vector of length 3]. Where the date vector is made up of (year, day of year, pruning fraction)}

\item{caltT}{Matrix timeseries of forest thinnings of dimension [length of timeseries, date vector of length 3]. Where the date vector is made up of (year, day of year, thinning fraction)}

\item{n}{Length of run in days}

\item{NOUT}{Number of output variables}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix of dimension [length of run in days, number of outputs]
}
